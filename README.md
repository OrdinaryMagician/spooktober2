# Spooktober 2: Spook Them All

### — Alright, What The Fresh Heck Is This?

Remember **Spooktober**? Oh, that was a good time, the very first community map project I led. Come to think of it, it's been four years since then *(as of writing this)*, and the idea just came up among friends that perhaps a sequel is due. And, after the flop of trying to organize a **Strife** project, it does seem like this will instead become the thrilling conclusion to the **Lords of Terror** trilogy after all. How interesting...

This time around, the story takes us to a haunted mall. Long since abandoned due to unspecified circumstances, it appears that a certain wandering entity has settled here following the infamous *"rain of skeletons"* incident that ensued after the destruction of a certain haunted mansion, and it has sent out a message for any would-be hero to approach and dare to take on the challenges of the many parallel worlds that are bound to this locale.

And so, it is up to you, the player, to do so. Driven by the conviction that there might be some juicy reward waiting, you have answered the call of the elusive *"Man in the Mirror"*, and nothing will stop you on this quest, not even the fresh corpses of others who tried before you.

### — Project Organization

For now I'd just like to have one map per author. This of course excludes me doing the hub and the boss maps.

There will be no deadline, but once all slots are full and everyone has finished their maps, the project will be officially released during the next Halloween night, that's basically how it'll go this time. Deadlines only serve to add unnecessary pressure and stress on the mappers. Everyone should work at the pace that's best for them *(I mean, as long as you don't delay things on purpose to be a jerk)*.

The maps have to be either something spooky, or just simply fitting the theme of **Halloween** stylistically. References to horror games are welcome *(we had plenty of those in the previous entry)*.

The current plan is to have 13 maps. That's the sum of hub map, 7 regular maps, 3 secrets, final boss and secret boss.

We're still far from the estimated start date for the project, and the layout of the hub and everything else isn't set in stone yet, but feel free to contact me if you wish to participate, nevertheless, and I'll keep you updated on when this thing will formally begin.

### — Assets And Whatnot

Feel free to suggest any texture packs to be included for the maps, as well as custom monsters. So as to keep things safely compatible with gameplay mods, let's avoid custom weapons and items this time. For music, sequenced formats *(midi or tracker module)* are preferred, but if you use streamed formats please use ogg or opus and try to stay under 3MB maximum. The previous **Spooktober** was considerably large in size just from the music alone, which was a problem.

### — Whatever Else

I think that's all I have to say for now. I plan to start working on this between August/September of 2022, hope to see you all then.

Man, to think this whole idea came from a dream I had...
